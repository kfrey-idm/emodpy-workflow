# Welcome to emodpy-workflow

emodpy-workflow is a collection of commands and interfaces intended to support data-driven
scientific computing workflows. In particular, its core currently standardizes the system

Teams of users can more easily work with each other's projects using emodpy-workflow as it
provides standard way of using EMOD-HIV.
